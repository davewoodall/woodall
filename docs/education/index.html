<p class="p">My traditional education focused around communications and finance. Those experiences served me well as an entrepreneur. I applied my experiences into starting three successful (as I define success) companies and selling one of them.</p>

          I used many of my school based projects to start my first t-shirt company. I had a captive audience in the student body who were my first customers. My college experience was the perfect startup incubator.

<p class="p">I started coding by myself but knew I would benefit from taking some courses. Thankfully, that was around the time that the first coding bootcamps started.</p>

          Yes, <i>THE</i> Sandi Metz! I had the tremendous opportunity to take her 3-Day Object Oriented course. I had already read "POODR" twice. She solidified many of the views about software. I am eternally grateful to Phishme for making this happen.

          I attended Code Academy, which suffered from being named the same as the popular online site named the same but was not affiliated. The Code Academy I attended was the first popular Coding Bootcamp. I was the third class and the last one before the movement exploded. It was an amazing 3 month experience which gave me the confidence to forge ahead in my new career.

          RMSC offered a week long bootcamp experience that gave an intense overview of all things software. It was a great way to get my bearings before I started Code Academy.
