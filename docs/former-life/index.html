I was already gaining traction with my apparel business so I saw no reason to change course back then.

          I co-founded AMB3R with $5,000 and a vision to sell t-shirts differently. Our first year we sold $380,000 in apparel. We sold almost $1M the fourth year, which is the year I sold to my business partner so that I could subsidize my switch into becoming a full time developer.</a>

          Futureshirts was a small music merchandise company doing about $2M in annual revenues. I was responsible to aquire new business, servicing customers with new product and design ideas. Oftentimes, it was easier for me to design my own graphics for their merchandise so I was able to lean on my graphic design experience.

          I went to a religious college. As such, I started a tongue and cheeck clothing line titled 'church clothes'. Some of my favorite experiences building the brand were selling into 100 retailers, opening two Mall kiosks, and producing a 7 city promotional music tour by select retailers.
