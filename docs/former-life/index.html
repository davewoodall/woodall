          I started AMB3R with a vision to become the <i>Starbucks of t-shirts</i>. The company begain with $5,000 in capital and lots of ambition. Our first year we sold $380,000 in apparel. I soon realized that our business model needed custom software, which I couldn't afford. So I started teaching myself to code. I attended a 3 month bootcamp and realized that writing code is in itself a full-time occupation. I'm glad I made the switch. Who knows, maybe one day I'll go back to selling t-shirts. But right now, I am very happy writing code for a living!<br>You can see the first website I ever built. HTML &amp; CSS hand coded website. I'm pretty proud of it! <a href=''>visit old AMB3R site.</a>

          This was a full season of my life. I was attending Grad School, building AMB3R when I was recruited by a Privat Equity firm to join the new management team of Ouray. I hired, fired, and managed 9 graphic designers to release 1,200 graphics a year. We won small business of the year in 2011. I was an awarded a patent for a t-shirt concept I created.

          Futureshirts was a small music merchandise company doing about $2M in annual revenues. I was responsible to aquire new business, service them with new products and designs. Oftentimes, it was easier for me to design my own graphics for their merchandise.

          I went to a religious college. As such, I started a tongue and cheeck clothing line titled 'church clothes'. Some of my favorite accomplishments were selling into 100 retailers, opening two Mall kiosks, and producing a 7 city promotional music tour by select retailers.
