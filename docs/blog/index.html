  <p class='p'>
<p>I was recently on the market for a new static site generator. I vistied <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">Static Gen</a> to compare static site generators. My preference was a Ruby site so I narrowed in on middleman, jekyll, and nanoc. I decided on nanoc for a few reasons.</p>

<p>First, I wanted to have a site that was more than just a blog. Jekyll is by far the strongest leader of blog sites. I had used middleman in the past and liked the flexibility. Truth be told, what had me try nanoc was that there were Zero issues or pull requests on a repo containing over 5,000 commits. Impressive! That gave me the sense that any question or issue I might have would be resolved quickly.</p>
