<p>I was recently on the market for a new static site generator. I looked at the lists of popular options. I vistied <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">Static Gen</a>, a site designated to comparing static site generators, to see what was available. My preference was a Ruby site so I narrowed in on middleman, jekyll, and nanoc. I decided on nanoc for a few reasons.</p>

<p>First, I wanted to have a site that was more than just a blog. Jekyll is by far the strongest leader of blog sites. I had used middleman in the past and liked the flexibility. Truth be told, what had me try nanoc was that there were Zero issues or pull requests on a repo containing over 5,000 commits. Impressive! That gave me the sense that any question or issue I might have would be resolved quickly.</p>

<p>I followed along the tutorial but found it lacking a few specific steps. Specifically, I wasn’t sure how to deploy or post a blog. I googled for a few tutorials and was surprised to discover the most popular one was from 2012 that covered Nanoc Version 3. Nanoc is now on Version 4.</p>

<p>This post collects the best content from the nanoc tutorial, david clrk’s post, and my own additions. Feel free to read those but I want to have a complete step by step process in one post. So here goes!</p>

<h2 id="step-1-installation">Step 1. Installation</h2>

<p>Let’s install nanoc, create a site, and add a gemfile.</p>

<p><code>gem install nanoc</code></p>

<p>Once that installs, you can use</p>

<p><code>nanoc create-site [site name]</code></p>

<p>The official tutorial has readers installing global gems rather than managing the site’s gems through a gemfile. I prefer a gemfile so I created one with the following gems</p>

<p>```
gem ‘nanoc’       # because it’s a nanoc site
gem ‘kramdown’    # markdown
gem ‘adsf’        # server
gem ‘stringex’    # string parsing
gem ‘rake’        # have some rake tasks</p>

<p>group :nanoc do
  gem ‘guard-nanoc’
end
```</p>

<p>Nanoc does a good job of keeping out extra content. The point that I have to deliberaly create a gemfile and a rakefile is proof that this project is not currently suffering from bloat. That’s a good thing to me!</p>

<p>Run <code>bundle</code> to install those gems.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-viewing-locally">Step 2. Viewing locally</h2>

<p>Nanoc serves static content. By default, nanoc puts all static content into a folder called ‘output’. We’re going to use github pages to serve our site and github uses a directory called <strong>docs</strong>.</p>

<p>Override the output directory by visiting <code>nanoc.yaml</code> and changing the line like so;</p>

<p><code>output_dir: docs</code></p>

<p>Nanoc comes with an empty <code>output/</code> directory but we don’t need that so you can just delete it.</p>

<p>In order to create a static version of the site, run the command</p>

<p><code>bundle exec nanoc</code></p>

<p>If all goes well, here is what the output should look like;</p>

<p>```
$ bundle exec nanoc
Loading site… done
Compiling site…
      create  [0.00s]  docs/index.html
      create  [0.00s]  docs/stylesheet.css</p>

<p>Site compiled in 0.01s.
```</p>

<p>To view your site locally run</p>

<p><code>bundle exec nanoc view</code></p>

<p>You should see your new site at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/">localhost:3000</a></p>

<h2 id="step-3-improving-development-experience">Step 3. Improving development experience</h2>

<p>Nanoc outsources live reload to guard, which is why we installed guard-nanoc. Let’s create a nanoc guard file.</p>

<p><code>bundle exec guard init nanoc</code></p>

<p>Now, run <code>bundle exec nanoc live</code> to have live updates.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-deployment-to-github">Step 2. Deployment to Github</h2>

<p>I like to deploy as soon as possible so I know the rocket can get off the launch pad.
If you have a github account and know how to use it, then this part will be very easy for you. If you are not familiar with github, please <a href="">visit this page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sidenote-nanoc-deploy">Sidenote nanoc deploy</h3>

<p>Nanoc comes with <code>nanoc deploy</code>. However, I found the explanation and implementation to be more complicated than necessary. Github allows static sites to be served from master branch out of a specific directory called <strong>docs</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="configuring-github">Configuring github</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new repo</li>
  <li>follow typical git commands;</li>
</ol>

<p><code>
git init
git add .
git commit -m "New Nanoc Site"
git remote add origin [YOUR REPO HERE DUDE]
git push -u origin master
</code></p>

<p>Then, visit /settings and change the static site to ‘master/docs’</p>

<p>Once you push your repo, then your site is deployed!</p>

<h2 id="but-but">But but..</h2>

<p>At this point you may have run over to your newly deployed site and noticed that it doesn’t look like the local one.</p>

<p><img src="" alt="picture of local" /></p>

<p><img src="" alt="picture of deployed" /></p>

<p>At this point, you have two options;</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simply add a CNAME to <code>content/</code> directory and github pages will use that domain.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>

<p>If you don’t want to go out and buy a domain name everytime, then you probably want the ability to manage urls dynamically. Let’s address that in the next post…</p>

<p>be nanoc –env=[prod]</p>

<h1 id="problem--">problem -</h1>
<ul>
  <li>stylesheets / dynamic paths</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>nanoc.yaml comes as a @config</li>
  <li>need an env variable</li>
  <li>build some link_to helpers for stylesheets</li>
  <li>how to deploy with nanoc stylesheets</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="step-4-introducing-some-guts">Step 4. Introducing some guts</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Or, you need to configure base url. Let’s proceed with configuring the base_url.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>be nanoc --env=[prod]</code></p>

<h2 id="adding-content">adding content</h2>

<p>All our code will be managed in <code>content/</code>, <code>layouts/</code>, <code>Rules</code>, and <code>lib/</code>. We will talk about these later.</p>
