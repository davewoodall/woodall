bio:
  <span class='h4'><b>Senior Software Developer</b></span> of Ruby on Rails and VueJS applications. What I enjoy most about web development is that it boils down to effective communication. I work best on small and medium size remote teams who employ tools like Slack and Jira to ship software. I try to roll my R's when I say <i>SCRUM</i>. Feel free to <a href='/contact/'>contact me</a> if my profile matches your needs. And, thanks for stopping by!
