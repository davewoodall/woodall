        <h1>I was big in Japan</h1>
        <p>About four years ago I tried to buy this domain name but it was taken by a Japanese Jeans Company ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ So, I opted for <a target="_blank" href="http://dave.woodalls.me">dave.woodalls.me</a> instead. </p>
        <p>I was recently in the market for a new pair of jeans which prompted me to check if my name was still in vogue. It was bitter sweet to discover this domain name was available. As they say, <i>beauty is fleeting.</i></p>
        <p>I've been coding since 2008. Currently, I work remote full-time as a Ruby on Rails full-stack developer. Which means, I also write HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  I actively <a href="https://cooperpress.com/">follow news</a> to stay up to date in each of the respective technologies I regularly use. I am a curious introvert and prefer to work with distributed teams but also willing to work on site for the right situation.</p>

        <p>As a former Art Director, I still enjoy UI/Design tasks like wire framing, UX diagrams, and mentoring graphic designers who want to learn to code.</p>

        <p>I also <a href="https://dribbble.com/wwwoodall">dribbble</a> for fun.</p>

        <h1>Eat. Sleep. Code.</h1>

        <p>In 2007 I discovered <a href="http://www.basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> which lead me to <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> <em>(Rails)</em>. Rails inspired me to build my own <i>project management tool</i> which has taken longer than anticipated :-) I test with <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">Minitest</a>, monitor with <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>, and deploy with <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. I am excited for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0WUjGkDFS0">Action Cable</a> which will ship as part of Rails 5.</p>

        <p>I prefer <em>vanilla</em> JS over <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. The Rails apps I've worked with tend to use <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> (and/or)  <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. I use <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> for testing. I am excited about the future of <a href="https://babeljs.io/">BabelJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features/blob/master/README.md">ECMA 6</a>, and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">ReactJS</a>.</p>

        <p>I build static sites with <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> because it is very similar to Rails. It's written in Ruby, has an <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Asset Pipeline</a>, local server, and gems for developing with sophisticated tools. Then, with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">free static site hosting from GitHub</a> that makes deployment easy and free!</p>

        <p>I enjoy <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/open-source/#front-end">thoughtbot's front-end suite</a> (Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters). I write SCSS and regularly try to apply methodologies like <a href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> and <a href="https://en.bem.info/">BEM</a> as best I can.</p>

        <p>HTML could be defined in broader terms as <em>View management</em> to include working with JS frameworks, Rails partials (ERB/SLIM), responsive web design, and cross browser testing.</p>

        <h2 id="bc-before-coding">B.C. <em>(before coding)</em></h2>

        <p>During college I started a t-shirt business. The year was 2000 and the <em>dot com</em> bubble had just burst so I deduced the web was a fad and should focus on the apparel industry. It only took eight years to realize I was wrong.</p>

        <p>I began to view code as a new form of literacy. Like many people, I had lots of Internet business ideas. But after several unsuccessful attempts with 3rd party sites, consultants, and other hacks I realized that I needed to learn to code for myself. So, I moved my family from Denver to Florida for three months so that I could attend <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">starter league</a> in Chicago. That was the catalyst I needed to make the switch.</p>

        <p>In total, I spent 17 years in the apparel and music industries including - three turnarounds, founding two companies, and selling one. I have experience with acquiring profitable customers and I'm formally trained with a Masters in Finance.</p>

        <p>Coding is my fifth career and by far my favorite of them all. My longest active commit streak is <a href="https://github.com/woodall">193 days</a>.</p>
