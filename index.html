        <h1>I was big in Japan</h1>
        <p>A few years ago I tried to buy this domain name but it was taken by a Japanese Jeans Company ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ So, I opted for <a target="_blank" href="http://dave.woodalls.me">dave.woodalls.me</a> instead. </p>
        <p>I was recently in the market for a new pair of jeans which prompted me to check if my name was still in vogue. It was bitter sweet to discover this domain name was available because that meant I'm not as popular in Japan as imagined. As they say, <i>beauty is fleeting.</i></p>

        <h1>Eat. Sleep. Code.</h1>
        <p>Currently, I work full-time as a remote Ruby on Rails developer which means, I also write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I actively <a target='_blank' href="https://cooperpress.com/">follow news</a> to stay up to date in each of the respective technologies. I am a curious introvert and prefer to work with distributed teams.</p>

        <p>In 2007 I discovered <a href="http://www.basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> which lead me to <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. Rails inspired me to build my own <i>project management tool</i> which has taken longer than anticipated :-) I test with <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">Minitest</a>, monitor with <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>, and deploy with <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. I am excited for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0WUjGkDFS0">Action Cable</a> which will ship as part of Rails 5.</p>

        <p>I prefer <em>vanilla</em> JS over <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. The Rails apps I've worked with tend to use <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> (and/or)  <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. I use <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> for testing. I am excited about the future of <a href="https://babeljs.io/">BabelJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features/blob/master/README.md">ECMA 6</a>, and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">ReactJS</a>.</p>

        <p>I build static sites with <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> because it is very similar to Rails. It is written in Ruby, has a local server, and gems for developing with sophisticated tools. Then, with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">free static site hosting from GitHub</a> that makes deployment easy and free!</p>

        <p>I enjoy <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/open-source/#front-end">thoughtbot's front-end suite</a> (Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters). I write SCSS and regularly try to apply methodologies like <a href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> and <a href="https://en.bem.info/">BEM</a> as best I can.</p>

        <p>I've often said that <i>HTML is the New English</i>. It is a powerful language used to speak through the browser. But to think of it in broader terms, as <em>View management</em>, to include working with JavaScript frameworks, Rails partials (ERB/SLIM), responsive web design, and cross browser testing.</p>

        <p>Coding is my fifth career and by far my favorite of them all. My longest active commit streak is <a href="https://github.com/woodall">193 days</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="bc-before-coding">Before Coding</h2>

        <p>During college I started a t-shirt business. The year was 2000 and the <em>dot com</em> bubble had just burst so I deduced the web was a fad and should thus focus on the apparel industry. It only took eight years to realize I was wrong.</p>

        <p>Some of my past experiences include: founding two companies, winning small buiness of the year, selling a business, selling over a million t-shirts, receiving a patent, and earning a Masters in Finance. As a former Art Director, I still enjoy UI/Design tasks like wire framing, UX diagrams, and mentoring graphic designers who want to learn to code.</p>

        <p>What got me to finally learn to code was that like many people, I had lots of Internet business ideas. But after several unsuccessful attempts with 3rd party site building tools, hiring consultants, and other hacks I realized that I needed to learn to code for myself. I began to view code as a form of literacy. So, I moved my family from Denver to Florida for three months so that I could attend <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">starter league</a> in Chicago. That was the catalyst I needed to make the switch to a full-time coder.</p>

        <p>For fun, I <a href="https://dribbble.com/wwwoodall">dribbble</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/allbusinessdave'>make movies</a>.</p>
