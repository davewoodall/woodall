This post is going to cover a few of the basics in hopes to give you the confidence that you too can write technical blogs.

But first, I want to share a few reasons why I write blog posts. I want to start here to give you additional motivation and determination to write so that you can break through any kinds of obstacles.

Blogging is a great way to introduce yourself. The exercise of blogging is writing. Good writing takes time, effort, and determination. Good writing is rare. Good writing captures the readers attention. Bad writing makes you start scrolling.

Blogging is also a great way to market yourself. You can demonstrate your grasp of subjects that companies are in the market for. By blogging about your skills, you set yourself apart as someone who is genuinely interested in the subject and not just saying so during the interview.
