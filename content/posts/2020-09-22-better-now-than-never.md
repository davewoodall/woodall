The nitty gritty details of data structures, algorithms, and the underlying math do not come naturally for me. However, I do find the subjects fascinating. It is easy to feel that the level of granularity is a waste of time, or taking too much time.

Yet I should apply the same mindset I had when taking accounting classes 13 years ago. That is, the tedious nature of details takes time for everyone who studies them. I happen to be learning these things now. Better now than never.

I am learning what they are, why they are, and how to think with them. The purpose of these topics is because I am hitting the limits of the machine, and that's pretty cool. It is possible for me to write code which a machine cannot process in the required amount of time.
