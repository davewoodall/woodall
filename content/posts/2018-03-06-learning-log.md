Permit me to state the obvious. As software engineers we are in a constant state of learning. This is done through a variety of ways and means. I have become used to the fire hydrant mentality that is the norm for a developer.

I would like to do a better job of recording some of the resources that really benefit me in my daily goal of personal improvement. I'm going to attempt to do this by updating this page.
