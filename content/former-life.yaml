title: fomer life
description: Before writing software I was a business owner, art director, and graphic designer. I completed undergrad in 2000, the year the Tech Bubble burst. I was already gaining traction with my first t-shirt business so I saw no reason to change course back then. Call me slow, but it took me eight years before I realized that the Internet was here to stay.
