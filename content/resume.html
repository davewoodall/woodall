          <p class="summary p">I started AMB3R with a vision to become the <i>Starbucks of t-shirts</i>. The company begain with $5,000 in capital and lots of ambition. Our first year we sold $380,000 in apparel. I soon realized that our business model needed custom software, which I couldn't afford. So I started teaching myself to code. I attended a 3 month bootcamp and realized that writing code is in itself a full-time occupation. I'm glad I made the switch. Who knows, maybe one day I'll go back to selling t-shirts. But right now, I am very happy writing code for a living!</p>
